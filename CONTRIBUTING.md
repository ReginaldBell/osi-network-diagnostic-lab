# Contributing to OSI Network Diagnostic Lab

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project is designed as a professional, evidence-driven OSI diagnostic lab for SOC, NOC, and SRE use cases. To maintain its integrity and value, please follow these guidelines:

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `master`.
2. **Document all changes** clearly in your pull request, especially for evidence or documentation updates.
3. **Do not delete or overwrite evidence** (screenshots, logs) unless explicitly approved.
4. **Do not refactor lab logic or structure** without prior discussion (open an issue first).
5. **Reference all new evidence** in the appropriate README or evidence index.
6. **Follow the OSI-layer methodology**: one layer, one variable, one change at a time.
7. **Sign your commits** if possible.

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and constructive.
- No destructive actions (force-push, history rewrite, file deletion) without consensus.
- All contributions must preserve evidence integrity and auditability.

## Reporting Issues

- Use the `issues/` folder structure for incident reports.
- Attach supporting evidence (screenshots, logs) whenever possible.
- Clearly state the OSI layer and failure domain.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the MIT License.
